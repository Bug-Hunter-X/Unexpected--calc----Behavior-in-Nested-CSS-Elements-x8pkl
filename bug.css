The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a nested element might not produce the expected result due to the context of the percentage calculation.  The percentage is calculated relative to the parent element, and subtracting a fixed pixel value afterwards might not account for padding or border affecting the parent's size.
